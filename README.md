User story: 
    AS A        consumer who likes going out to eat/ordering in
    I WANT      an application that helps narrow down my dinning options
    SO THAT     I can find a restaurant that sounds "good"   

MVP Acceptance Criteria:  
    The user gives their location. 
    The application provides users with a RANDOM # of generic food "categories" (Mexican, Thai, American comfort, etc).
